1
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,792
Do you need a hand?

2
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,833
Move in further.

3
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,333
Come. Come over here.

4
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,792
All right.

5
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,750
You need to buy a ticket.

6
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,125
Is there no discount?

7
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,625
Don't block my way.

8
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,125
还没找着啊？
Have you found it yet? Just pay for the ticket.

9
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,791
赶快补票吧 别费劲了
-Stop wasting my time. -Can you check the others first?

10
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,583
您能不能先查后面？

11
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,750
我找着之后就给您看
-I will show you my ticket once I find it. -No.

12
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:16,666
不行
Just give me a second.

13
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,666
您让我再找一下
I know, you won't find it.

14
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,166
找什么啊？肯定找不着

15
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,083
像你这样丢三落四 丢票的这种啊
I've seen plenty of people who act like they have lost their ticket.

16
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,166
我见多了

17
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,666
你这么着 我呢 给你补票 是吧？
Just buy the ticket from me at its original price

18
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,625
按原价补
or the officer will show up and issue you a fine.

19
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,208
别等会儿 乘警一来罚你款怎么办？

20
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,833
不是 您让谁来 我也得找到我的票啊
I still have to find my ticket regardless of who will show up.

21
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:31,875
-我买票了 -来 乘警

地上这票是你的吧？
This ticket belongs to you, right?

26
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,708
我登机了
I've boarded the plane.

27
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,583

三带二
A pair of Threes.

54

我最恨春节
I hate New Years.

72
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,041
每年赶回家过年都跟逃难似的
Traveling back home every year is always a disaster.

73
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,791
火车上那么挤
The train is always crowded.

74
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,333
我都得憋着尿 要不我就不喝水
Either I have to hold in my pee or I just can't drink anything at all.

但有一点不好
But there's one problem.

78
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,458
他妈的下个雪、下个雨
When it rains or snows, the traffic would get so congested.

79
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,666
都他妈交通堵塞
That's right. Once, I had to work late

80
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,791
对 有一天天气预报说有暴雨

81
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,375
那天刚好我回家晚
and the storm was pretty bad.

82
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,875
我们家那时候住五环
I lived at Fifth Ring Road.

83
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,583
我从三环就开始走 一直都打不着车
I had to walk from the Third Ring road because I couldn't get a cab.

84
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,875
我都要走绝望的时候碰见一大哥
I was so desperate.

85
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,958
愿意给我拉顺风车
But I met a guy who was willing to give me a lift.

86
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,250
大半夜的 陌生人的你也敢上？
You accepted a ride from a stranger at midnight?

87
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,375
妈啊 我那凄凉的啊 就是鬼开的车我都上
I was miserable.

88
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,458
I would've accepted the ride even if the driver were a ghost.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,083
然后呢？
And then what happened?

90
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,375
然后呢 就成了我的前男友啦
The driver is now my ex-boyfriend.

-我跟我老公都生第三孩子了 -你在北京过得怎么样啊？

146
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,041
-阿姨过年好 -小晓

147
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,166
前两天改煤气管道想找你呢
I called you two days ago to change the gas pipe.

148
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,916
-你那电话也打不通啊 -我换电话了
-I couldn't reach you. -I changed my number.

149
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
小晓 你回来啦？
Xiao-xiao, you're back. Give me your address in Beijing.

150
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,791
你北京地址留一个

151
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,625
-我年底要结婚了 -行
-I'm getting married. -Okay.

152
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,625
小晓回来啦？
Xiao-xiao, you're back.

153
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,125
-过年好 -过年好
-Happy New Year! -Happy New Year!

154
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,083
过年好
Happy New Year.

155
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,333
喂？妈
-Hello, Mom. -<i>Where are you?

156
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,291
在哪呢？

157
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,583
-刚到家 -东西收到了吧？
-I just got home. -<i>Did you get the stuff?

158
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,541
你什么时候北京有个固定的地址？
<i>When will you have a formal address in Beijing?

159
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,666
老这么费劲吧啦的 给你寄东西也不是办法
<i>It's troublesome to send you stuff without an address.

160
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,416
我不是 我不是回来吃巧克力的
No, I'm not home for chocolates.

161
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,791
我回来看我爸的
I'm here to see Dad.

162
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,291
一会儿就吃年夜饭了
The New Year feast will be ready soon.

163
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,458
饿
I'm starving.

164
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,458
每年就这几道菜
It's the same dish every year.

165
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,833
也没点新鲜的
There's nothing new.

166
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,750
再说了 粘豆包呢？
Where are the sticky bean buns?

167
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,875
没有粘豆包怎么算过年？
It won't feel like New Year without it.

168
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,666
什么时候少过你粘豆包啊？
I always prepare them.

169
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,083
你那中学老师啊 前两天来家吃饭
Your high school teacher came over for dinner the other day.

170
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,416
说他女儿 跟你是一级的
He mentioned that his daughter is in the same grade as you.

171
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,416
在北京读
She is now studying in Beijing.

172
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,250
政法大学
-University of Political Science and Law. -That's too far.

173
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,583
太远了
I don't want to have a long-distance relationship.

174
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,208
我对异地恋没兴趣

175
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,708
昌平
It's only in Changping.

176
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,125
有那么远吗？
Is it really that far?

177
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,083
不行
It's too far for me.

178
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:07,000
那你舅舅给你介绍那朋友呢？
How about the one that your uncle introduced to you?

179
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,333
你就别瞎操心了
Stop worrying about me.

180
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,208
你自己还没找明白呢
-You should worry about yourself. -What are you talking about?

181
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,875
-你自己找明白… -你说什么呢？

182
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,291
我告诉你啊
I'm telling you.

183
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,333
毕了业就给我滚回来
You better come back here once you have graduated.

184
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,833
做游戏有什么出息？
There is no career in making video games.

185
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:27,917
A SPRING FILLED WITH HAPPINESS A YEAR FULL OF PROSPERITY

186
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,667
It's not working.

187
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,750
I couldn't light this one.

188
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,875
Yes, it went off.

189
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,625
再点一个
One more.

190
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,208
这个 这个好
This one works.

191
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,083
鞋好走吗？
Are those shoes comfortable?

192
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,291
好走的都不好看
Not really, but the comfortable ones are so ugly.

193
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,542
Goodness.

194
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,041
你们家这门口不知道扫扫雪啊？
You need to clear the snow off your porch.

195
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:03,958
你扫啊
-You do it. -What?

196
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,666
叔叔好
-Hi, sir. -Hey.

197
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,333
-你好 -这我爸
That's my dad.

198
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,166
-吃了吗？ -吃了
-Have you eaten? -Yes, I have.

199
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,125
年夜饭哪有吃了的？再来吃点
You can always have more food on New Year's Eve.

200
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,875
来了
GOOD FORTUNE

201
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:17,791
-来 -给我让一下
This is Lin's best dish.

202
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,458
这可是老林的拿手菜

203
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,416
-你们先吃着 -想老林的年夜饭想了一年了
Here.

204
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,417
-This year, I've missed his cooking. -Have some first.

205
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,291
-这是我跟我妈唯一的合照 -老林 快点啊
This is the only picture I had with my mom.

206
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,291
你在哪啊？
-Where are you? -In her belly.

207
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,625
肚子里面

208
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,541
来
-Cheers. -Come on.

209
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,083
我老伴啊上加拿大
My wife went to Canada before New Year.

210
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,666
就留我一个人在家待着
I stayed home all by myself.

211
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,250
我女儿也嫁到了重庆
My daughter got married to a man from Chongqing.

212
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,791
初二才能回来过年呢
She won't be back until the second day of the New Year.

213
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,583
小晓 你和见清在一起多久了？
Xiao-xiao.

214
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,750
How long have you been with Jian-qing?

215
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,416
她不是我女朋友
-She is not my girlfriend. -What?

216
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,416
小晓
Xiao-xiao.

217
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,208
我们都是过来人
We've all been there.

218
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,541
是不想让你们走弯路
I just don't want you wasting time,

219
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,041
尤其是要处对象的时候
especially when it comes to finding your other half.

220
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,958
你要先摸清对方是什么背景
You need to check their backgrounds,

221
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,416
什么来路
their origins,

222
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,291
要祖宗八辈地查
and even trace their ancestry.

223
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,083
尤其…你让我说完
Especially--

224
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,750
-我这说个话 你也拦着我 -姨
Let me finish. I'm still talking. Don't interrupt me.

225
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,625
明年除夕夜 我要是没地儿去
If I have nowhere else to go the next New Year's Eve,

226
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,416
我还要来陪叔叔阿姨们喝酒
-I will come here and drink with you all. -That's great!

227
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,000
-好 -好 欢迎
Great!

228
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,375
-年年来啊 -好
You should come every year.

229
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,666
你爸好手艺啊
Your dad is a great cook.

230
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,291
好久没有过过这么开心的年了
I haven't had a good time during New Year for a long time.

231
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,916
你们老家也没有人
There's no one at your place.

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,166
你说你何必挤着春运回来呢？
Why did you go through all the trouble of coming back?

233
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,583
其实就是找个回家过年的理由
I'm just finding a reason to spend time at home during New Year.

234
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,375
我妈这人是不可能回来了
My mom would not come back.

235
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,791
我要是再不回来 就没人管我爸了
If I didn't come back, my dad would be left alone.

236
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,166
你知道吗？ 你跟我见过所有的女孩都不太一样
You know, you are not like most girls that I usually meet.

237
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,166
你会骂人
You curse people.

238
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,375
会打牌
You know how to play cards and you drink well.

239
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,666
还会喝酒

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,583
还有什么我不知道的？
What else do I not know?

241
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,416
其实我有好多
Actually, there's quite a lot that you still don't know.

242
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,166
你都还不知道的

243
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,083
我就说你这鞋不好走吧
I told you that it'd be hard for you to walk in these shoes.

244
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,333
我扶你
Hey, let me help you.

245
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,250
你说咱们家这地儿
Our neighborhood...

246
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,208
这么多年了 一点变化都没有
hasn't changed much after all these years.

247
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,500
就像时间停住了一样
It's like time has stopped.

248
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,500
有的时候我就想起我爸
Sometimes, I would think of my dad...

249
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,708
因为我妈怀我的时候
because when my mom was pregnant with me,

250
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,791
我爸回老家陪我妈
my dad came back to keep her company.

251
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,333
所以小的时候我就想
So as a kid, I would always say to myself,

252
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,250
等我长大了我一定会离开这里
I will definitely get out of here when I grow up and I'll go on my own path.

253
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,416
我得去闯一闯

254
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,541
他们说在北京待够五年
People say that, in Beijing, five years is enough

255
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,875
就可以扎根了
for you to walk your own path.

256
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,708
你待多少年了？
How long have you stayed there?

257
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,583
大学四年算吗？
Does four years in college count?

258
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,625
当然不算
Of course not.

259
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,333
那我还没开始呢
So that means I haven't started.

260
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,416
你喜欢北京吗？
Do you like Beijing?

261
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,333
我感觉我都撑不住了
I think I'm not going to make it.

262
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,250
就跟我四年前刚来北京一样
Nothing has really changed

263
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,833
一点起色都没有
since I first arrived four years ago.

264
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,916
别啊 你就差这一年
Come on. There is only one year left for you.

265
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,916
你不怕你之后你老了你后悔啊？
Aren't you afraid that you'll regret it later?

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,791
你想说我再坚持一年 我就成功了呢
If I had stayed for another year, I would have made it.

267
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,083
-是 -是吧？
-Is that so? -Yes.

268
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,125
-我就这么想的 -坚持
-That's what I thought too. -Hang in there.

269
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:32,416
新的一年 我要找一个好工作！
It's a new year.

270
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,375
I want to get a better job.

271
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,250
我新年的第一个愿望
The first wish I have this year

272
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,291
就是要嫁个北京人！
is to marry a local guy in Beijing.

273
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:42,416
我一定会成功 衣锦还乡！
I will make it and come back home with honor.

274
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,791
你傻啊
You silly!

275
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,625
都衣锦了还还什么乡啊？
Why go back home if you've made it? Just stay in Beijing.

276
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,583
留在北京
You're so silly!

277
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,833
你才傻呢

278
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,541
能在北京生活对我来说
<i>Living in Beijing has always been a dream of mine.

279
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,750
一直是一个梦

280
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:55,000
在北京 好像每天都能遇到新鲜事
<i>There's always something new here,

281
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,541
遇上有趣的人
<i>someone interesting,

282
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,000
所有的梦想都能实现
<i>and all of your dreams can be fulfilled here.

283
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,125
虽然挣的钱不多
<i>Even though the salary might not be much,

284
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,875
空气和水也没有家乡的好
<i>and the air and water are not as clean as in our home,

285
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,583
但是我得试过了
<i>I have to at least try.

286
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,833
才甘愿回到小城市
<i>Or I won't be willing to return to a small city,

287
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,500
去过结婚生子、柴米油盐
<i>to marry someone,

288
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,125
平淡的下半生

00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,125
-Put it on my tab. -<i>and live an ordinary life.

290
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,208
我一定得坚持下去
-<i>I have to hang in there. -Come in and take a look!

291
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,750
北京 谁怕谁？
<i>Bring it on, Beijing!

292
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,791
毕了业 谁愿意离开北京？
<i>Who would want to leave Beijing after graduation?

293
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,291
每次路过天安门的时候我就在想
<i>Every time when I pass by Tiananmen,

294
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,583
所有最好、最神奇的事情

295
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,166
都会在这里发生

296
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,083
我明白北京不是我的家
<i>I know that Beijing is not my hometown.

297
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,375
我宁可拥抱现实中的无家可归
<i>I would rather embrace the fact that I might fail in life.

298
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,583
也不想放弃搏一把的机会
<i>I wouldn't want to give up the chance to go all in.

299
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,791
都说这儿的生活艰难 但老子不怕
<i>They say that the life here is hard, but I'm not afraid.

300
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,375
至少我在北京混过
<i>At least I've been to Beijing and have lived here.

301
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,458
北京的一天真的很短
<i>A day in Beijing is really short.

302
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,208
短到还没有开始就结束了
<i>It seems like the day ends even before it begins.

303
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,750
所以每天早上一睁眼
<i>Every day when I wake up,

304
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,666
我就觉得我离梦想又进了一步
<i>I feel like my dream is turning into reality.

305
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,875
喂

306
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,541
你们这儿有人坐吗？
Is this seat taken?

307
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,625
您好 您的碗筷

法学博士

313
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,625
博士 是吗？
PhD?

314
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:24,083
地震局不就是个土行孙的活吗？ 是吧？
Your job is to dig like a groundhog in that bureau, isn't it?

315
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,083
土行孙是什么啊？
What do you mean by that?

316
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,583
土行孙就是
Well...

317
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,625
相貌堂堂…
-You're a handsome groundhog. -Just ignore them.

318
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,333
-甭搭理他 甭搭理他们 -一看就是搞土地的

319
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:33,875
我男朋友其实
Actually, my boyfriend is not that special.

320
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,833
也没有什么能耐
He is just a small-time government officer.

321
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,916
就是一小小的公务员

322

The house we bought is around 4,000 to 5,000 RMB per square meter.

324
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,291
顶多也就四、五千一平

325
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,041
没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

326
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,916
-也就四、五千一平？ -四、五千
What do you mean by that?

327
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,333
什么叫才四、五千？
Only 4,000 to 5,000 RMB?

328
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,958
四、五千你拿得出来啊？
Do you even have that much?

329
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:53,958
你掏得出来吗？
Do you have it?

330
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,666
别酸了 来
Stop being sarcastic. Come on.

331
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:56,958
有本事咱拿瓶干

咱大老爷们喝酒
My mom said girls shouldn't drink so much.

333
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,458
我妈说了 女孩不能随便喝酒

334
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,791
喝酒对身体不好的
It's bad for your health.

335
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,000
我可以 我可以喝的

网上
From the internet.

341
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,666
网友
We're virtual friends.

342
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,041
厉害吧？
Isn't it cool?

343
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,041
靠谱吗？
Is it safe?

344
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,041
多大啊？
How old is he?

345
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,083

He's 27.

346
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:36,708

-He's 27? -Yes.

347
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,000
说是你爸我都相信
He could pass for your dad.

348
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,208
你有毛病吗？
What's wrong with you?

349
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,750
你咋啥也不懂呢？
You just don't get it. That's because I look much younger.

350
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,125
是因为我长得小

351
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,583
他对你好吗？
Does he treat you well?

352
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,958
你那不废话吗？
Of course!

353
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,458
怎么个好法啊？
How exactly does he treat you?

354
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,916
能为你上九天揽月
Picking stars for you from the sky? Bringing pearls to you from the ocean?

355
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,166
下五洋捉鳖啊？
Stars?

356
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,583
上啥？
Pearls?

357
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,000
下去捉谁？
What?

358
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,958
捉谁？

359
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,500
就是为了你什么都肯干
I mean, would he do anything for you and give you anything you want?

360
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,125
什么都能给你

361
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,541
我们搞电脑的
We are in the computer business. How can we work without electricity?

362
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,458
插座没电 我们怎么做生意啊？

363
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,541
年轻人
Young man.

364
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,833
出来创业带着脑子好不好？
Have some sense in you.

365
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,958
不动脑子能做成事吗？
How will you make it if your brain is useless?

366
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,416
我带什么脑子？
-What did you say? -Hey.

367
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,125
你干吗你？
-What are you doing? -You better watch out!

368
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,583
胜哥

00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,708
胜哥 这都是我的老乡们
Sheng, these people are from my hometown.

374
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,958
一起来北京打拼都特别不容易
It's hard to make a living here in Beijing.

375
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,125
麻烦您帮帮他们吧
Please help them if you can.

376
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,041
-好不好？ -行
-Sure. -Is it okay?

377
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,333
看在小晓的面子上
Thanks to Xiao-xiao, I will arrange it in the afternoon.

378
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,083

380
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:52,791
好 再见啊

-好 -你这鞋还真漂亮
Your shoes are really pretty.

382
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:58,958
还是你厉害
That was great.

383
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,500
知道我这鞋的厉害了吧？
Now you know the power of these shoes.

384
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,208
矮就矮吧 这么不自信啊？
It's okay to be short. You should be more confident.

385
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,458
你以为我为你穿的啊？
I'm not wearing them for you.

386
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,708
这你一言我一句的啊
Well, look at you two fighting.

387
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,541
你是不是喜欢人家啊？
Do you have feelings for her?

388
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,333
喂

我有事儿跟你们说
I need to tell you something.

391
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,041
前几天我爸妈给我打电话

他们在县里给我找了个公务员的工作
They got me a job as one of the officials in the county.

393

明天我要离开
<i>I have to leave tomorrow

394

熟悉的地方和你

401
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,542
<i>Cherish how you longed for me

402
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,916
阿文 我出去一下

<i>Until forever

406

你这里面装的什么啊？这么重
What is in this? It's so heavy.

407
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,083
我的鞋
My shoes.

408
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,541
还有我全部家当
These are all my things.

409
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:01,875
FORTUNE, WEALTH, AND HAPPINESS

410
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,167
Goodness.

411
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,541
这个房间什么都有
This room has everything.

412
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,750
热了 咱们就开点电风扇
You can turn on the fan if it gets hot.

413
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,708
你怎么不问我怎么了？
Why don't you ask me what happened?

414
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,000
分手了吧
You broke up.

415
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,666
我真是仁至义尽了
I did everything I could.

416
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,833
他妈来北京 我亲自给他妈换拖鞋
I even helped his mom put on her slippers.

417
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,541
吃饭的时候 我吃口菜都得看他妈的脸色
During dinner, she gave me attitude every time I took a bite.

418
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,791
关键他妈死活不同意我俩在一起
She just wouldn't approve of us.

419
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,291
说我连大学都没有上过
She said that I don't go to college so, we'd have trouble communicating.

420
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:10,416
以后交流肯定有问题
And while she was saying all that stuff,

421
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,166
关键他妈说这些话的时候

422
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,125
他坐旁边 一个屁都不敢放
he just sat there, and didn't even say a word.

423
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,875
他妈的
Damn it.

424
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,791
听起来觉得你有点像骂人
It sounds like you are cursing them.

425
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,833
我就是他妈的想骂人
Hell yes. I'm cursing them.

426
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,958
好不容易谈个靠谱的恋爱

嗯 拜拜
Okay, bye.

572
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,000
你眼睛擦亮点啊
Keep your eyes open.

573
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,250
现在的老男人骗子可多了
There are a lot of liars here.

574
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:24,833
你小心让人给骗了
Don't get tricked by them.

575
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,041
你这就是赤裸裸的嫉妒
You are just jealous.

576
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,250
明白
I get it.

577
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,875
娘家人一般都护犊子
All mothers will protect their kids.

578
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,541
我嫉妒你啊？
I'm jealous of you?

579
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:38,166
想跟我好的女生都排到张家口啦
Girls get in line just so they can be with me.

580
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,041
我嫉妒你
Jealous, my ass.

581
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,333
你是说你电脑硬盘里的女的吧？
Do you mean the girls in your hard drive?

582
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,666
你偷看我电脑啊？
Did you use my computer?

583
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,666
真有啊？
So you do have porn?

584
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:53,708
你是不是又抽烟了？

585

你赶紧走啊 走了我就能抽了
Hurry up and leave, so I can smoke freely.

590
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,666
你抽吧 抽死你
-Sure, let it be the death of you. -I'll keep smoking.

591
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,041
-就抽 -早抽早超生
The more you smoke, the faster you die.

592
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,333
就抽 做鬼都不会放过你
Sure, I will visit you even when I'm dead.

593
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,416
你这少白头看时间长了还挺帅
Your white hair looks nice after a while.

594
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,125

595
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:53,750
你是担心我啊？
You worry about me a lot.

596
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,083
你是不是看上我了？
Are you falling for me?

597
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,833
你还真以为你自己是花朵啊？
Do you really think you're pretty?

598
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,458
有一点吧
Maybe a little. Sort of.

599
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,166
-一点没有吗？ -可没有啊
Not at all.

600
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,625
-你是不是看上我了？ -没有
-Are you into me now? -No.

601
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,416
我的天啊

602
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,791
干吗呢？
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

603
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,750

I can't take it!

608

让人听见了
Stay away from me!

609
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:40,750
Someone might hear you!

610
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,541
-我的天啊 -别叫
Stop screaming!

611
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,750
你这一声儿不叫
If you don't scream,

612
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,541
你要不出声儿 人家以为你休克了
they might think you've passed out.

613
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,375
别人以为你虚了呢
They might think you're weak.

614
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,291
跟着我来
Do as I say.

615
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:58,583
我的天啊

616
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,166
受不了了
I can't take it!

617
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,208
I can't take it!

618
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,250
跨年优惠
A special discount! Buy five and get one for free.

619
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,375
买五送一

620
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,416

Come and have a look.

621
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,541
来 笑一个
Come on. Smile.

622
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,375
怎么着？跨年没人陪你啊？
What's wrong? No one to celebrate with?

623
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,166
这我男朋友给我办的新号
My boyfriend got me a new number. It's our love hotline.

624
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,500
爱的热线
I will call you from over there. Let's try it.

625
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,583
我那边去给你打个电话 你试试

626
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,083
这声音清晰吗？
Is it clear?

627
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,458
是不是一般二般的手机 都跟它比不了？
No ordinary phone can compete with it.

628
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,791
今儿是跨年 他怎么不陪你啊？
It's New Year's eve. Why is he not with you?

629
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:51,375
人家是大领导 有好多应酬呢
He's the boss now. He has meetings to attend.

630
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:52,791
谁跨年应酬啊？
Meetings on New Year's eve?

631
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,916
他对你不好
He is not treating you well.

632
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,833
他对我好 怎么可能对我不好啊？
Of course he is. Why wouldn't he be?

633
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,625
你要再这么说他 我跟你急
Don't say that about him or I'll get upset.

634
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,166
送你手机不算对你好
Giving you a cell phone doesn't exactly mean he's nice.

635
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,000
你管得真宽
You are really nosy.

636
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,375
怎么？城管又来了？
Are the inspectors going to be here again?

637
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,041
走 跨年去
Come on. Let's go celebrate.

638
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,000
原来他有老婆
He has a wife.

639
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,458
就说不好看吧
I told you it's ugly.

640
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,708
走吧
Come on.

641
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:59,458
-来！
Here.

642
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,625
It's 20.

643
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,791
5 喝酒
It's five. Drink up!

644
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,625
去他妈的2007
Fuck 2007!

645
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:23,416
去他妈的2007
Fuck 2007!

646
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:25,000
去他妈的2007
Fuck 2007!

647
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:27,958
我觉得2007就是给幸福的人过的
I think 2007 is for happy people.

648
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,416
幸福的人会越来越幸福
The ones that are happy will be happier.

649
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,416
悲惨的人会越来越悲惨 对吧？
The ones that are miserable will be worse.

650
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,500
不对
-No. -Why not?

651
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:33,750
为什么不对？
If two miserable people end up together,

652
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,833
两个悲惨的人在一起

653
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,000
就幸福啊
they will be happy.

654
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,500
就像老子的鞋一样
Just like my shoes.

655
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,250
越换越精彩
It will keep getting better.

656
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:41,500
越挫越勇
It'll keep getting tougher.

657
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:45,916
咱们还年轻
We are still young...

658
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,250
而且咱们这么聪明
and we are pretty smart.

659
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:50,291
穷只是暂时的
We won't stay poor for long.

660
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,750
我们一定会发达的
We will definitely make it in the end.

661
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,708
我们一定会发达的
We will be so successful.

662
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,166
那还要
Well...

663
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,083
再等多久呢？
How long is that going to take?

664
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,375
-三年 -我不信
-Three years. -I don't think so.

665
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,458
我不信
I don't think so.

666
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:06,250
最多三年
Three years at most.

667
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,250
我不信
I don't believe it.

668
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,583
我要在北京买八套房子
I will buy eight houses in Beijing.

669
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,166
到时候我送你一套
I will give you one for free.

670
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,000
咱们做邻居
We can be neighbors.

671
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,125
那那么多房子
If you had so many houses,

672
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,875
打扫起来也是个问题
it would be an issue to maintain them.

673
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,750
我们就要放在那 看着
It's good to just look at them.

674
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:25,875
高兴
It would make me happy.

675
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,208
我真的觉得
I really think

676
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,750
咱们这样挺好
what we have is quite nice.

677
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,541
对吧？
-Right? -Yes.

678
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:41,583
现在就剩下你跟我了
It's just you and me now.

679
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:49,875
你听
Listen.

680
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,583
咱们穷的日子已经开始倒计时了
That's the countdown to the end of us being poor.

681
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,166
好的生活马上就来了
The good life is just ahead of us.

682
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,000
五！
Five.

683
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,625
-四！ -三！
Four.

684
00:40:58,708 --> 00:40:59,666
二！
-Three. -Two.

685
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,083
-一！ -一！
-One. -Happy New Year!

686
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:04,958
新年快乐

687
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:04,833
Happy New Year!

688
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,375
等一下
Wait.

689
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:29,458
喂？
Hey.

690
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,708
你什么意思啊？
What's wrong with you?

691
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:33,541
你不打一声招呼你就走
Leaving without saying a thing.

692
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,916
我给你打了一天电话你都不接
I've been calling you all day, but you didn't answer.

693
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,166
你当我们家是避难所 还是你的旅馆啊？
Do you think this is your shelter or a hotel?

694
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,041
你想来就来 你想走就走
You can come and go as you want.

695
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,291
你当我是什么啊？
What am I to you?

696
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:43,000
你懂不懂得尊重人啊你？
Do you have any respect?

697
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,625
喂？
Hey.

698
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,916
你说完了吗？
Are you finished?

699
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,041
说完了
<i>Yes!

700
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,583
那还能当朋友吗？
Can we still be friends?

701
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,000
我当时真这么说啊？
Did I really say that?

702
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,333
你知道你那句“还能做朋友吗？”
Remember the time you asked me if we could still be friends?

703
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,083
杀人不见血
-Yes. -That was really cold.

704
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,416
那是你第一次吧？
That was your first time, right?

705
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:18,375
你别忘了啊 是谁先把谁的衣服给脱下来的啊？
Did you forget?

706
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,375
You were the one who took your clothes off first.

707
00:44:18,458 --> 00:44:21,750
是我 利利索索先把自己衣服脱了
I did. I quickly undressed myself.

708
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:22,958
然后我帮着你脱
And then I undressed you.

709
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:25,041
你磨磨唧唧
You were still unsure about it.

710
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,416
最后都脱光了 还剩只袜子
You were all naked, but you had a sock on.

711
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,416
我没脱袜子啊？
I didn't take off my socks?

712
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,500
你全身上下就剩一只袜子
Yes. You were only wearing a sock.

713
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,208
我那会就觉得我把你给睡了
I thought that if I had sex with you

714
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,208
你就会跟我一辈子
you would be with me forever.

715
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:40,875
早知道不睡了
I shouldn't have done it.

716
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,625
你真是挺幸运的
You are really lucky.

717
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,083
这一辈子
In your life,

718
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,916
能够睡一个像我这样的
you get to score someone like me.

719
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,958
但我就是后悔
But I came to regret it.

720
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:51,625
那我不喝了 你这个二蛋
Then I won't drink with you, bastard.

721
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:54,833
其实我那会还真挺喜欢你骂人的
I actually enjoyed hearing you curse then.

722
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:57,375
骂两句
Say it again.

723
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:58,708
二蛋
Bastard.

724
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,625
来点刺激的
Make it exciting.

725
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,208
来点刺激的
Make it exciting?

726
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:05,333
来点刺激的
Make it exciting.

727
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:06,916
再来点狠的
Say something meaner.

728
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,333
你还记不记得你当时
Did you remember during that time

729
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,708
每次咱俩要那个啥的时候
whenever we were going to do it...

730
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,833
我来啦
I'm coming.

731
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:16,375
你不就喜欢我这一出嘛
You liked me doing that.

732
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,000
我不知道你要干啥
I had no idea what you were doing.

733
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:23,625
脱下来以后
After you took your clothes off...

734
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:24,833
你看
Look.

735
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:27,875
我来啦
I'm coming.

736
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:31,041
我来啦
I'm coming.

737
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,041
你当时就这样的
You were acting like this.

738
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,625
And you're still nagging.

739
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,583
见清
Jian-qing.

740
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:22,125
见清 我恋爱了
Jian-qing.

741
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,083
Jian-qing, I'm in love.

742
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:30,541
好久不见 见清不在
I haven't seen you in a while. Jian-qing doesn't live here anymore.

743
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:31,833
他上哪去了？
Where did he go?

744
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:33,833
进去了
He's in there.

745
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,583
进哪啦？
Where?

746
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,833
进去了啊
In there.

747
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,916
他怎么啦？
What happened to him?

748
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:46,916
你学我啊？
Are you imitating me?

749
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,291
干我们这行 一年进去两三趟
It is pretty normal in this business

750
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:52,500
要多正常有多正常
to go in there a few times a year.

751
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:56,666
拘留期间不受理探访 回去吧
No visitors during custody. Please return.

752
00:46:55,958 --> 00:47:00,583
IN REPENTANCE, THERE IS SALVATION

753
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,208
-北京欢迎你 -北京欢迎你
<i>Welcome to Beijing

754

-有梦想谁都了不起 -有梦想谁都了不起

755
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:30,666
-有勇气就会有奇迹 -有勇气就会有奇迹
<i>The courage can create miracles

756
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,125
-好 -好
-To Beijing! -Yes, Beijing!

757
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,666
-敬北京 -对 敬北京

758
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,791
叔叔、阿姨 以后你们要去北京
If you ever go to Beijing,

759
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:37,250
一定要联系我和见清
remember to find me and Jian-qing.

760
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,708
住我们家 吃我们家 一定啊

-好 -好 谢谢
-Great! -Thank you.

762
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,625
小晓啊
Xiao-xiao.

763
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,250
见清大过年的也不放假啊？
Jian-qing can't have a break on New Year?

764
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:46,791
就是他们这次电玩展
Well, it's the video game convention.

765
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:49,000
其实好多人都争破了头都要去
Many of his colleagues wanted to go,

766
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,916
他老板独独就选了他
but his boss picked him.

767
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,500
他其实特别想叔叔、阿姨们
He really misses you all.

768
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,291
他就买了好多礼物提前
He went shopping for gifts very early and asked me to give them to you.

769
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,875
让我一定带给你们

770
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,416
叔叔 见清说你的那个皮带 那皮子都烂了
Uncle.

771
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,458
Jian-qing said your belt has worn out.

772
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,166
你看看 惦着你呢
See. He thought about you.

773
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,291
叔叔
Uncle.

774
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,458
你们一年才回来一次
You two only come home once a year.

775
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:08,333
今年要不回啊
If you didn't come, it would've been two years since you last saw your parents.

776
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:10,375
那就两年见不着爹妈了

777
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:13,583
见清两天三头的就给叔叔打电话
Jian-qing calls Uncle pretty often.

778
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:15,083
是吧 叔叔？
-Right, Uncle? -Xiao-xiao.

779
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,416
小晓 你们在一起多久了？
How long have you been together?

780
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,541
三、四个月了吧
-It has been three to four months. -I see.

781
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:21,458
那平时避孕了吗？
So do you guys use protection?

782
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,750
这有什么的啊？
Don't be shy.

783
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,041
我这不是管计划生育的嘛
My line of work is about family planning.

784
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,583
老林啊
Lin.

785
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:33,125
就盼着你们赶紧回来请咱喝喜酒呢
He is looking forward to hearing your good news

786
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:34,250
最好就是能赶紧生个娃
and having a baby soon.

787
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:37,708
那过年才真有意思呢 是不是？
Only then, New Year will be merrier, right?

788
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,000
阿姨慢走
Bye, Aunt.

789
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,375
老林 我走了啊
Lin, I'm leaving.

790
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:42,916
我明天再过来
I will come by tomorrow.

791
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,375
游戏算正经行吗？
Is video gaming a serious job?

792
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,500
你不沾手了
Don't get your hands dirty. Don't mind it.

793
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:54,791
别沾手了

794
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,083
他初中二年级的时候
When he was in eighth grade,

795
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:02,291
我带他出差去北京
I took him on a business trip to Beijing.

796
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,500
路过中关村的时候啊
When we passed by Zhongguancun,

797
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,208
看见卖游戏的正版碟
we saw a store selling authentic PC games.

798
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:10,125
《命令与征服》
Command and Conquer.

799
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:14,833
太贵了 160块
It was really expensive. It was 160 RMB.

800
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:17,666
那时候我月工资
Back then, my salary was less

801
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,916
不到1000块
than 1,000 RMB a month.

802
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,583
第二天我去厕所刷牙的时候
The next day, when I went to the bathroom,

803
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:24,833
他把门锁上了
he locked me in the bathroom.

804
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,541
我说：“你干什么？”
I asked what he was doing.

805
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,125
他说：“你给我买张碟吧”
He told me...

806
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,167
to buy the game.

807
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,458
我说：“我揍死你”
I said I would beat the crap out of him.

808
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:37,416
他说：“你要是给我买了
He said that if I bought it for him,

809
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,500
揍死就揍死吧”
it would be okay to get beaten by me.

810
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,083
然后呢？
-Then? -I bought it.

811
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,041
买啦

812
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:49,291
有次喝了酒给我打电话 说：“爸爸谢谢你
One time, he called me while he was drunk and said, "Thank you, Dad.

813
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,333
你要没给我买那张碟
I wouldn't know what I'd be doing now if you didn't buy that game for me."

814
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:54,250
我还不知道现在干什么呢”

815
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:57,250
我就想
So I was wondering.

816
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,708
他这么迷恋这游戏
He is so obsessed with gaming.

817
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,666
是不是我害了他啊？
Did I contribute to it?

818
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:18,708
LIN'S RESTAURANT

819
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:25,958
见清
Jian-qing.

820
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:27,291
没事吧？
Is he all right?

821
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,208
没事
Yes, he is. I'll get going now.

822
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,375
叔叔 我走啦

823
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:13,375
IN REPENTANCE, THERE IS SALVATION

824
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:16,083
HAIDIAN PRISON, BEIJING

825
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:36,916
豆包 粘豆包
Bean buns? Sticky bean buns.

826
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,000
你去我家啦？
You went to my place?

827
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:42,166
对啊
Yes.

828
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,750
我就怕你穿帮嘛
I thought you might get caught,

829
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,833
我委屈求全装你女朋友
so I pretended to be your girlfriend.

830
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:49,291
你神经病啊你？
Are you crazy?

831
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,958
谁让你装我女朋友啦？
My girlfriend?

832
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:52,333
你这人怎么
Why are you being

833
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:53,708
狼心狗肺啊？
such a dick?

834
00:51:54,958 --> 00:51:55,916
走开
Go away.

835
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:00,791
跟你说个好消息
I have good news.

836
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,125
我又搞对象了
I met someone.

837
00:52:04,375 --> 00:52:05,208

838
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:06,291
不是
No.

839
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,875
有房子吧？
Does he have a house?

840
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,875
没有
No.

841
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:11,291
我都帮你一块问全了吧
I will answer all the questions for you.

842
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,083
他是国企的还是机关的？
Does he work in a state corporation or in an institution?

843
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:15,666
老不老？
Is he old?

844
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:16,916
都不是
The answer is no.

845
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,791
我这次交的这个男朋友吧
The boyfriend I have this time...

846
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,750

He...

挺年轻的
is rather young.

848
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:25,416
然后就是工作有点不稳定
But he doesn't have a regular job. He looks decent.

849
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,583
长得还行

850
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,750
你疯了啦你？那你养他啊？
Are you crazy? So are you supporting him?

851
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,625
那个有老婆的骗子 跑到我店里给我骂一顿
My married ex-boyfriend came to my shop and yelled at me.

852
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,166
说你把人狠狠揍了一顿 是吗？
He said that you beat him up.

853
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:39,708
没有
No.

854
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,791
他来买碟 就被我认出来
He came to buy some discs and I recognized him.

855
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,833
你愿不愿意为我
Would you...

856
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:59,125
上九天 那啥
fly to the sky

857
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,500
下九天捉鳖？
or what was it? Down the ocean?

858
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:04,250
上九天揽月
Pick the stars from the sky and bring pearls from the ocean.

这都是我游戏里的草稿

怎么从来没有一个故事

872
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:26,041
是从开头到结尾 它都是幸福的呢？

873
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:30,041
幸福不是故事

伊恩再也找不到凯莉的话
Ian could never find Kelly,

883
00:55:14,458 --> 00:55:15,875
不可以
No.

00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:38,916
把手拿过来
Give me your hand.

看来我还得再多补几根儿一会

卖楼挣得多一点

924
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,083
而且你最近不是也要 研究自己的新游戏了吗？

925
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:51,666
这样对咱俩来说可以减少点压力

你不是常说
Didn't you often say I'm good at making sales?

932
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:09,625

出门工作不再只是为了过日子

941
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:51,541
也是为了回到家时 看见她开心

漂在北京 两个人的生活
<i>Two people living in Beijing together

咱们生个孩子吧

万一有一天咱俩分手了

我还是得见你

你有必要知道我过得好不好吗？

980
01:02:04,041 --> 01:02:05,666
-我就是想知道 -关你屁事
-I just want to know. -It's none of your business.

981
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,416
那你是想知道我好
So would you want to see if I'm doing well or doing badly?

982
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,750
还是想知道我不好？

983
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:12,958
Tell me.

984
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,583
过得不好 我肯定会难过
I would be sad if you were miserable.

985

我也会难过
I would feel bad too.

987

跟我过得差不多吧
Maybe just be like me

988
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,500
比我差一点就行
or a bit worse than me.

989
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:27,875
不是 你这人怎么这样啊？
How can you say that?

990
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:30,000
你这人怎么希望你前任过得不好呢？
You want your ex to do worse?

991
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,541
-你怎么那么自私啊？ -不是
-That's pretty selfish. -No.

992
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:32,500
不是啊
Not at all. Think about it.

993
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,625
你想一想
If I weren't the only person who made you happy,

994
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,583
让你快乐的那个人不是我

995
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:37,958
我肯定不会开心
I would definitely be upset.

996
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:39,625
是吧？
Right?

997
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,625
我真希望时间就停在现在这
I wish time would stop now.

998
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,791
就永远停在这
Right now.

999
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:02,958
咱们为什么分手啊？
Why did we break up?

1000
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,583
不重要了
It doesn't matter.

1001
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:11,000
分手了还能见才重要
What matters is that we can still see each other afterward.

1002
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,375
说说你现在
So how are you doing now?

1003
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:18,833
一般吧
So-so.

1004
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:22,208
卖什么能赚钱就卖点什么
I sell whatever can be sold.

1005
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,500
婚恋方面
As for my love life or marriage,

1006
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,750
一直就没有碰到个靠谱的
I've never met anyone worthwhile.

1007
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,875
这不刚分手一个
I just broke up with one.

1008
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:30,166
假洋鬼子
A pseudo-foreigner.

1009
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
我还为他学了一年的英语
I even took English lessons for him for about a year.

1010
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:35,708
我都没钱了 他还骗我钱
I ran out of money, but he still scammed me.

1011
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,916
你不会真信了吧？
Did you really believe it?

1012
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,125
我真是不放心你
I'm worry about you.

1013
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,625
啥你都信
You would believe everything.

1014
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:49,333
捉弄我你就这么开心 是吧？
You really enjoy teasing me.

1015
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:53,083
我过得不好 你也挺开心的吧？
And you would be glad if I were miserable?

1016
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:56,208
就是想知道你过得怎么样
I just want to know how you've been.

1017
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,708
其实我结婚了
Actually, I got married.

1018
01:04:03,791 --> 01:04:06,083
过完年 我就要搬到美国去了
I'm moving to America after New Year.

1019
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,291
因为我俩刚刚在比佛利山庄
We just bought a huge house in Beverly Hills.

1020
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,291
买了一个大房子

1021
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:13,875
又骗我
You are lying to me again.

1022
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:16,208
不是 你看
No, I'm not. Look.

1023
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:18,000
我说真的你又不信
I'm telling the truth and you don't believe me.

1024
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,250
我常常不知道你说的哪句是真的
I don't know which one is true

1025
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,875
哪句是假的
and which one is not.

1026
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:24,958
善意的谎言
White lies.

1027
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,833
咱俩都没少说过
We both used it a lot.

1028
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:38,875
唉唷喂
-Goodness. -What?

1029
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:41,375
-怎么着？ -您车是租的吧？
Did you rent this car?

1030
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:42,708
N瑟个啥啊？
What are you gloating about?

1031
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:45,375
整个年终奖全都放这车上了吧？
You spent all your bonus on this, didn't you?

1032
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,000
还借了点
I borrowed some money too.

1033
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:48,958
全买烤鸭了
I spent it all on the roast duck.

1034
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:50,416
烤鸭先生
Mr. Roast Duck.

1035
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:56,625
来 敬北京回来的见清啊
Hey, a toast to Jian-qing from Beijing!

1036
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:57,708
同学们
Hey!

1037
01:04:57,791 --> 01:05:00,041
烤鸭人人有份
Everyone gets to taste the roast duck.

1038
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:01,416
带回来的特产
It's a local specialty. I got it for you.

1039
01:05:02,458 --> 01:05:04,083
你现在在哪呢？
Where are you working now?

1040
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:06,666
我还真没带名片
I forgot my business card.

1041
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,250
我在世贸天际
I work with WTC Skyline.

1042
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:11,041
他们公司五百人
The company has 500 employees.

1043
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:12,291
今年刚上市

1044
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,750
每年净赚就得十多个亿

1045
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,333
十多个亿
Billions.

1046
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,375
五百人分
For 500 people.

1047
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,625
一人一千多万呢
That's ten million each.

1048
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:21,458
你是不是傻？
Are you nuts?

1049
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,291
那十个多亿都是老板一个人的
The money goes to the owner.

1050
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:26,166
他还能五百个人分？
Why would he share it with 500 people?

1051
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:28,041
那不也是见清的嘛
That's also Jian-qing's share.

1052
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,875
以你的能力得单干
You should have your own business.

1053
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:32,041
他们老板就是舍不得放人
His boss wouldn't let him go.

1054
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:33,500
你说这愁不愁人
That's quite a dilemma.

1055
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,500
你找阿文啊
You should ask for Wen's help.

1056
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:38,166
他不是现在说混得特好嘛
He said he's doing pretty well lately.

1057
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:40,708
你让他给你去说啊
You can talk to him about it.

1058
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:43,208
-不用 -你直接给他打啊
-It's fine. -Just call Wen directly.

1059
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:44,250
别
No.

1060
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,500
大过年的

1061
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:46,791
我自己跟他说啊
I can talk to him myself.

1062
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:47,833

01:05:49,166 --> 01:05:51,291
现在是县长秘书

1065
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,875
那房子是咱们所有同学里边最大的

1066

车也是最好的
He has the best car too.

1067
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,458
这林见清也是
What's the matter with Jian-qing Lin?

1068
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:02,541
都一起长大的 装什么大尾巴狼啊？
We grew up together. There's no need for him to pretend.

1069
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,041
同学一场 大家是不好意思说破
We just don't want to say the truth.

He's still renting somewhere in Beijing.

1071

1072
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:11,000
将来买房、看病
When he needs to buy a house,

1073
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:12,333
孩子上学
go to the doctors, or send his kids to school,

1074
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:14,375
哪一样不得扒他一层皮啊？
they will all cost him a fortune.

1075
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:15,625
唉唷 算啦
Never mind.

1076
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:18,958
人就活一张脸 回来多丢脸啊
It's a matter of pride.

1077
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,541
朋友一生一起走
<i>Friends supporting each other in life

1078
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:27,958
那些日子不再有
<i>Those days are gone

1079
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:29,625
一句话
<i>A word of advice

1080
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:31,416

01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,041
-打一个 来 -来

1083
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:38,500

01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:41,458

-Give it to me. -Let me pay for it.

1085

-拿给我 -我们来买就行

1093
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,750
别
No.

1094
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:57,250
行了 我付了

1095
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:59,375
今天郑秘书买单
Secretary Zheng has already paid.

1096
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:00,500
本店招待老客户
We thank you for coming.

1097
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:04,166
你说等到你有一天真的挣到了大钱
One day, when you get really rich,

1098
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,958
你再好好请同学们吃顿饭
remember to treat us to dinner.

1099
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:08,250
好不好？
Okay?

1100
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:25,583
你不能喝就别硬喝
Don't drink too much if you can't handle it.

1101
01:07:27,291 --> 01:07:29,000
没钱就没钱吧
It's okay if you don't have money.

1102
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:31,250
何必打肿脸充胖子
You don't need to act like you do.

1103
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,791
你累不累啊？
Aren't you tired?

1104
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:40,000
累
Yes.

1105
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:45,625
就是因为这破地儿 我才这么累
I'm so tired of this place.

1106
01:07:46,458 --> 01:07:48,875
我不装
How will...

1107
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:51,333
我不装别人怎么看我？
How will they look at me if I don't pretend?

1108
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:00,875
我就不应该回来
I shouldn't come back here.

1109
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:03,291
走
Let's go.

1110
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,208
你跟他走吧
You can go with him.

1111
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,250
等他酒醒了
Don't let him drive the car.

1112
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:12,875
再让他动车
Not until he sobers up.

1113
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,916
我给你们做点吃的带上
I'll make you something for your trip.

1114
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:26,791
没事啊
It's fine.

1115
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,250
真的没事
It really is.

1116
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,125
赚不赚钱、结不结婚
Being rich, getting married,

1117
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:37,833
买不买房从来都不是你的目标
and having a house were never your goals.

1118
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:40,500
这不是你想要的生活
This is not the life you want.

1119
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,458
这不是你一直想要的生活吗？
Is this not the life you want?

1120
01:08:44,083 --> 01:08:46,750
但是因为我们两个现在在一起了
But we are together now.

1121
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,666
我觉得这些都无所谓了
I don't think any of that matters.

1122
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:54,166
什么叫在一起之后
What do you mean when you say

1123
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,291
你觉得无所谓了？
none of it matters?

1124
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,000
就是
Well,

1125
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:02,416
就无所谓吧
it just doesn't.

1126
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,250
什么叫你觉得无所谓了？
Why doesn't it matter anymore? Do you think I won't be able to make it?

1127
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:05,958
是不是因为你觉得我做不到？

1128
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,833
你不管做不做的到
Whether you make it or not,

1129
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:09,208
对我来说都不重要
it's not important to me.

1130
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,708
你不还是因为我做不到吗？
So you are saying that I can't make it. That is what you're saying.

1131
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:11,625
你是这个意思吧？
-I didn't say anything like that. -That's what you meant.

1132
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:12,750
我什么时候说过这句话啊？

1133
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:13,875
你就是这个意思

1134
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,125
不是 你爱怎么想怎么想
Think whatever you want.

1135
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:18,458
反正我没说过这句话
I didn't mean it like that.

1136
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:19,708
那你什么意思？
What exactly did you mean?

1137
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:22,041
你得知道你到底自己想要什么
You have to figure out what you want.

1138
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,125
我想要什么？
What I want?

1139
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:25,041
我他妈哪知道你到底要什么啊？
I don't know what you want.

1140
01:09:25,208 --> 01:09:26,583
你得知道你自己想要什么
You have to know what you want.

1141
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:27,708
不是因为我想要什么
It's not about what I want. And it turns into what you want too.

1142
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:29,708
你他妈才想要什么

1143
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:56,375
大过年就吵架
<i>Having a fight during New Year...

1144
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,291
果然这一年就过得不好
<i>No wonder it turned out to be a rough year.

1145

我都打了两天电话啦
<i>I've been calling for two days.

1146
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:11,250
少扯淡 给我退钱
<i>Stop talking nonsense. Give me a refund or just charge it...

1147
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,166
要不你就给我刷上去

1148
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,125
先生你好 请问您怎么称呼？

1149
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,125
称呼什么？
<i>Address me? Do we share the same last name?

1150
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,166
你跟我姓吗？
-<i>Are you my dad or what? -Sir, please calm down.

1151
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:18,583
-我叫你爸爸 -你说话客气一点

1152
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:21,541
你一个臭客服 你一个月挣几个钱？
<i>How much do you earn in a month?

1153
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:23,125
你他妈让我跟你客气
<i>You want me to be nice?

1154
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:24,875
凭他妈什么跟你客气？
<i>Why should I be nice to you?

1155
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:26,416
老子他妈花钱了
<i>I'm spending money here.

1156
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,375
我骂的就是你啊 臭土鳖！
I'm cursing at you, you pathetic loser.

1157
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,291
你他妈有点钱就装鳖 是吧？
You think you can be a jerk just because you are rich?

1158
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:32,833
不玩？不玩滚蛋！
Get lost if you aren't going to pay. Suit yourself!

1159
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:35,083
爱他妈玩不玩 靠！

1160
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:42,125
不好意思
Excuse me.

1161
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:44,916
请问一下客服部在什么地方？
Where is the customer service department?

1162
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,625
里边
It's in there.

1163
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:47,666
我想问一下
May I ask?

1164
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,541
哪位是1009号客服？
Who is Number 1009?

1165
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:58,916
你骂我土鳖
You called me a loser?

1166
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,541
你爸爸来了！
The loser is here.

1167
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:02,041
来 干他！
Teach him a lesson.

1168
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:07,375
你就跟着哥干两年 不就是女人嘛
It's just women. You should come working with me.

1169
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:09,500
你有钱了还怕找不到妹子
Girls will line up for you when you become rich.

1170
01:11:09,583 --> 01:11:12,833
到时候排着队跟你好 撵都撵不走
You wouldn't be able to shake them off.

1171
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:31,500
你总看他们干吗？
Why are you staring at them?

1172
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,666
我看看都不行啊？
I'm just looking.

1173
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,083
是不是喝多了？
Are you drunk?

1174
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:43,750
咱回家吧
Let's go home.

1175
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,708
我外号叫什么你不知道啊？
Don't you know my nickname.

1176
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,041
看什么啊 哥们？
What are you looking at?

1177
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,333
喝多了吧？
You had too much to drink.

1178
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:56,916
不理他 再喝点吧
-Just ignore him. -Let's ignore him.

1179
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,083
你他妈是不是有病啊？
What's your problem?

1180
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,416
你跟我说你到底怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

1181
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,333
你不是要打架吗？
Do you want to fight? Then punch me.

1182
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:21,791
你打我吧？

1183
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:22,916
打
Do it.

1184
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:24,416
打啊
Go ahead.

1185
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,708
如果要是开始建地铁的话
It won't be the same price once the subway has been built.

1186
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,041
至少得翻个两、三倍吧
The price will be doubled or tripled.

1187
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,750
就这一户保留户
There is only one reserved.

1188
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:13,291
所以买毛坯房比较划算
Buying a semi-finished house is cheaper.

1189
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:15,916
你看这个价钱和这个位置要都行的话
If the price and location are good for you,

1190
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,125
你就别犹豫了
don't hesitate to buy.

1191
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:20,500
我觉得这儿的景观的确还不错
I think the view here is good.

1192
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,375
挂这行吗？
-Can I hang it here? -Yes.

1193
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:30,291
可以

1194
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,833
小伙子 过年回家吗？
Hey, are you going home for New Year?

1195
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:34,041
回
Yes.

1196
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,791
叔叔好
-Hi, Uncle. -Hi.

1197
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:36,750
你好

1198
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:44,791
你看我电脑啦？
Did you use my computer?

1199
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:45,791
没有
No.

1200
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,375
你电脑刚刚一直响
It kept making sounds.

1201
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:49,708
我就看了一眼
So I took a look.

1202
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:52,416
这个夜精灵女只是一个网友
The night elf is just an internet friend.

1203
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:54,208
网友
An internet friend?

1204
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:56,541
你们都聊什么了啊？
What are you two chatting about?

1205
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,125
她是做房地产的
She's in the real estate business.

1206
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,250
我想到时候如果我们买房子的话
I thought if we were going to buy a house,

1207
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,916
还能便宜一点
it could be cheaper.

1208
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,375
买个大一点的
We should get a big house,

1209
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:07,958
到时候我爸也能住过来
so my dad can come live with us.

1210
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:11,250
我一卖房子的 你不问我
I'm an agent too. You can ask me.

1211
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:14,125
你问一个八竿子打不着的人
Why are you asking someone you don't know?

1212
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:15,750
你什么意思啊？
What's the matter with you?

1213
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:38,041
喂？
Hello.

1214
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,708
我跟你讲啊 我有亲戚要来住
<i>I have a relative coming to stay.

1215
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,416
你们赶紧把这个房子腾出来
<i>Clear the house immediately. Please move out by tomorrow.

1216
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,791
明天就得搬走

1217
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:38,833
师傅 开车
Driver, let's go.

1218
01:16:56,541 --> 01:16:57,416
喂？叔叔
Hello, Uncle.

1219
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,208
小晓啊 你们好吗？
<i>Hi, Xiao-xiao. How are you doing?

1220

1222

1223

1227
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,250
爸 你糊涂啦？

-<i>We don't need sticky bean buns anymore. -I've saved some for you.

1232
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:30,791
我还给你留着呢

1233
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,750
你别瞎操心了
<i>Stop worrying so much.

1234
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:34,208
家里人挺多的啊？
<i>There are many people in the house, right?

1235

多 今天都坐不下了
Yes.

1236
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:37,667
There are not enough chairs for them.

1237
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:39,833
你们不用惦记我啊

1243
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:52,833

你不打算说话了 是吧？
So you don't want to talk?

1254
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,500
面我给你剩了一半
I left some noodles for you.

1255
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:26,625
分手以后
After we break up,

1256
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:28,791
我们就不要再见面了
we should stop seeing each other.

1257
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,041
见清
Jian-qing.

1258
01:19:58,791 --> 01:19:59,916
我走了啊
I'm leaving.

1259
01:22:10,333 --> 01:22:12,041
如果当时你没走
If you didn't leave,

1260
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,250
后来的我们
would it make any difference

1261
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,666
会不会不一样？
to our relationship?

1262
01:22:21,416 --> 01:22:22,500
如果当时
If at that time

1263
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:24,500
你有勇气就上了地铁
you had the courage to get on the train,

1264
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:27,250
我会跟你一辈子
I would've stayed with you forever.

1265
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:32,541
如果当时你没有跟我分手
If you didn't break up with me...

1266
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:35,708
那我们之后也会分手
We would break up eventually.

1267
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,833
如果当时足够有钱
If we had enough money,

1268
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:42,291
我们住进一个有大沙发的大房子
we could live in a big house with a couch.

1269
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:49,208
你可能已经找了不下十个小三了
You would probably have ten affairs.

1270
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,708
如果当时我们就是不管不顾
What if we just went for it and got married?

1271
01:22:59,791 --> 01:23:01,583
我们就是结婚了呢？

1272
01:23:01,666 --> 01:23:03,041
我们离婚好多年了
We would've been divorced for years.

1273
01:23:03,458 --> 01:23:05,541
如果你可以陪我坚持到最后呢？
What if you could stay to the end with me?

1274
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:08,291
那也许你就不会成功
Then maybe you wouldn't make it.

1275
01:23:09,583 --> 01:23:11,375
如果我们没有离家去北京
What if we didn't leave for Beijing?

1276
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:16,291
如果没有如果
If there are no more ifs...

1277
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:22,666
后来的我们什么都有了
We have everything in the end.

1278
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:30,000
却没有了我们
Just not each other.

1279
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:01,583
林见清
Jian-qing Lin.

1280

你还没回北京啊？
You haven't gone back to Beijing?

1281
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:05,875
你好
Nice to meet you.

1282
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,291
这么巧啊？
What a coincidence.

01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,875
恭喜你拿下个大单子啊
Congratulations on the big order.

1284
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:14,791
好好放松放松
Get some rest.

1285
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,583
早点休息
Go to bed early.

1286
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:32,833
我不想回房间了
I don't want to go back to the room.

1287
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:36,625
好
Fine.

1288
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,375
我们租车吧
Let's rent a car

1289
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:43,708
开车回北京
and drive back to Beijing.

1290
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,083
太他妈搞笑了
It's too funny.

1291
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:55,916
就是说本来我还可以当正宫
I could've been the wife.

1292
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,958
现在还被当成小三了
But now I'm just the home-wrecker.

1293
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:04,458
遇见你我他妈是真倒霉啊
It's a real bummer to have met you.

1294
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:08,666
火车停开 飞机停飞
The train has stopped. The plane has stopped.

1295
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:10,541
现在连路都走不了了
Now the road is closed.

1296
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,541
我还能再遇见什么倒霉的事？你说
Can I be more unfortunate?

1297
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,708
你还想怎么样？
What do you want anyway?

1298
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:16,583
要不是因为你
If it wasn't for you,

1299
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:19,583
我能在北京耗这么多年吗？
would I spend all those years in Beijing?

1300
01:25:20,083 --> 01:25:21,583
我应该
I should

1301
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:23,416
给你颁个奖
give you an award

1302
01:25:24,125 --> 01:25:25,916
最佳前女友
for being the best ex-girlfriend.

1303
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:31,083
对 你确实该颁给我
Right. You should.

1304
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:33,833
因为我这个人
Because my good fortune always bring luck to my ex-boyfriends.

1305
01:25:33,916 --> 01:25:36,250
确实挺旺前男友的

1306
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:38,208
我记得我前前前男友
I remember my ex-boyfriend,

1307
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:39,750
前前前前前男友
my previous ex-boyfriend

1308
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:41,541
前前前前前前男友
and another previous ex-boyfriend...

1309
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:42,666
所有的前男友
To my knowledge, all my ex-boyfriends are doing pretty well.

1310
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,750
据我知道的 都过得他妈的挺好的

1311
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,083
就是因为跟我交往过
And that is all because of me.

1312
01:25:46,166 --> 01:25:47,416
所以我这个人
I'm the kind of person

1313
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
就是挺旺前男友的
who brings good fortune to my ex-boyfriends.

1314
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:52,083
我是不是特别帅这点？
Don't you find that very cool?

1315
01:25:52,833 --> 01:25:54,125
我觉得你特别惨
I find it very sad.

1316
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:56,916
一个人无依无靠
You are all alone.

1317
01:25:59,333 --> 01:26:00,416
挺惨的
It's pretty miserable.

1318
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,833
那我真的觉得你的价值观出现了问题
Then I think something's wrong with your values.

1319
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:08,375
我以前为什么死都要活在北京？
The reason I refused to leave Beijing...

1320
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:12,291
因为我觉得
is that I felt...

1321
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:14,708
如果生活在咱们的遥江镇
if we moved back to Yaojiang,

1322
01:26:14,791 --> 01:26:16,708
我一眼就看见我的未来了
I couldn't see my future easily.

1323
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:19,416
你现在也是啊
Well, you can see it now too.

1324
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:21,000
你娶妻生子
You are married with children.

1325
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,208
生活幸福
You live happily.

1326
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:24,708
有工作
You have a job.

1327
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:27,500
有稳定的生活
You lead a steady life.

1328
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,333
一眼就看见未来了啊
You see your future very easily.

1329
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:32,916
对
Right.

1330
01:26:40,291 --> 01:26:41,666
你说得对
You're right.

1331
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:43,291
见清
Jian-qing.

1332
01:26:43,833 --> 01:26:44,875
见清
Jian-qing.

1333
01:26:49,916 --> 01:26:51,583
I miss you

1334
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:57,708
我也想你
I miss you too.

1335
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,541
我是说
I mean...

1336
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,291
我错过你了
I missed you.

1337
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:17,375
我真觉得昨天就在眼前
I really feel like the past is right in front of us.

1338
01:27:22,708 --> 01:27:26,833
我觉得我们现在就像小时候一样 特别幼稚
We are as childish as when we were young.

1339
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,666
你一点都没有长大 你知道吗？
You haven't grown-up at all you know.

1340
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:41,083
你一点都没有让我刮目相看
You haven't impressed me at all.

1341
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,500
你知道吗？
Do you know that?

1342
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,916
我最大的悲哀就是
My deepest sorrow is I don't have the right to feel sorrow.

1343
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,208
我没有权利悲哀

1344
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,375
而且我也没有
And I'm...

1345
01:27:57,208 --> 01:28:00,416
我没有资格再为你做任何事情
in no position to do anything for you.

1346
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,750
我没有资格
I don't have the right to.

1347
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:16,750
你爱过我吗？
Did you even love me?

1348
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,666
你爱过我吗？
Did you?

1349
01:28:34,958 --> 01:28:36,666
我一直都爱你
I have always loved you.

1350
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:13,416
分手好像给了我一个喘息的机会
<i>The breakup gave me a chance to breathe.

1351
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:18,000
拼在北京就像上了赌桌
<i>Staying in Beijing is like a gamble.

1352
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:21,125
没有输光就还能再来
<i>Don't lose it all. Only then you'll have a chance.

1353
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,500
没死跟活着是两回事
<i>Although, living and not dying are completely different,

1354
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:29,416
但我必须逼着自己去全力以赴
<i>I have to find a way to go all out.

1355
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:40,583
SAY SORRY FOR ME IF YOU MEET KELLY

1356
01:30:40,666 --> 01:30:42,958
那如果在你这个游戏里面
What if in your game

1357
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:45,791
那个男的 永远也找不着这个女的了怎么办？
the boy can never find the girl?

1358
01:30:48,125 --> 01:30:50,458
伊恩再也找不到凯莉的话
<i>If Ian could never find Kelly,

1359
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:53,791
那这个世界就再也不会有色彩了
<i>then the world will be colorless.

1360
01:30:53,833 --> 01:31:00,042
UPLOADING

1361
01:31:00,417 --> 01:31:02,417
UPLOADED

1362
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,542
SAY SORRY TO KELLY FOR ME IF YOU MEET HER

1363
01:32:12,792 --> 01:32:14,500
I'M SORRY

1364
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:16,375
NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE HOW SORRY I FEEL

1365
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:18,333
SEEING THINGS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE SADDENS ME

1366
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:19,625
HOW SHOULD I MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

1367
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,500
欢迎加入我们的团队
Welcome to our team.

1368
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,208
光是在游戏下面留言说对不起的
<i>The number of online players that left sorry notes in the game

1369
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:57,666
在线累计人数

1370
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:00,083
刚刚已经超过两百万人
<i>have just passed 2 million.

1371
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:02,083
我开玩笑地问一句
<i>On behalf of the players,

1372
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:04,208
你有最想说对不起的人吗？
<i>I would like to ask, would you like to apologize to anyone?

1373
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:07,000
当然
<i>Of course.

1374
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:10,583
刚从老家来北京的时候谁没怀疑过
<i>I had my doubts when I first came to Beijing.

1375
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:14,208
谁没犹豫过自己的明天
<i>Wondering about my future...

1376
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:17,375
只有她
<i>Only her.

1377
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:19,875
只有她一直相信我可以做到
<i>She was the only one who believed in me.

1378
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:23,625
我记得有一天我们家电梯坏了
<i>I remembered that the elevator was broken one day

1379
01:33:23,791 --> 01:33:25,416
我们只能爬楼梯
<i>and we could only climb the stairs to get to our room.

1380
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:26,916
我说
<i>I said,

1381
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,083
我们讲一个故事吧
"Let's tell a story.

1382
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,083
因为只有一个有趣的故事
Because only an interesting story

1383
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:34,375
才能让那个楼梯爬起来更快一点
<i>can help us climb faster."

1384
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,541
从前有一个叫伊恩的小男孩
<i>A boy called Ian

1385
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,458
他跟好朋友凯莉走散了
<i>was separated from his friend named Kelly...

1386
01:33:41,541 --> 01:33:44,625
他觉得凯莉是被外星人给抓走的
He thought she was abducted by aliens.

1387
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:46,958
所以才不在他的身边
Because she was not with him.

1388
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:50,416
他在各个星球流浪 寻找凯莉
He wandered around different planets to find Kelly.

1389
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,041
他在寻找的过程当中
On his search mission,

1390
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:54,125
也是遇到了种种难关
he had gone through all sorts of difficulties.

1391
01:33:54,208 --> 01:33:57,833
陨石相撞、黑洞开启、蝙蝠袭击
A meteor collided, a black hole opened, and bats attacked him.

1392
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,041
还有一个通往天堂
There's a stairway that leads to heaven,

1393
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:03,208
但怎么走都走不完的楼梯
but it never seems to end.

1394
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:05,875
他必须找到通往天堂的钥匙
-He needs to find the key to it. -Find the key fast.

1395
01:34:05,958 --> 01:34:07,916
你赶紧把钥匙给我找出来

1396
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:09,916
我实在是爬不动了
I can't climb anymore.

1397
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:21,708
凯莉得好好跟着伊恩
Kelly needs to stay close to Ian.

1398
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,000
那伊恩得抓紧凯莉
Ian needs to hold Kelly tight.

1399
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,458
千万别走散了
So they don't get separated.

1400
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,291
只要伊恩和凯莉在一起
<i>As long as Ian and Kelly are together,

1401
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:31,333
他们就能勇闯星球 什么都不怕
<i>they can travel fearlessly to all planets.

1402
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:38,916
这就是我这个游戏的开始
<i>This is the beginning of my game.

1403
01:34:54,166 --> 01:34:55,583
这里是客厅
Here is the living room.

1404
01:34:55,666 --> 01:34:58,083
到时候 您跟家人朋友一块在这用餐
You can have dinner here with family and friends.

1405
01:34:58,166 --> 01:34:59,916
是一件特别温馨的事情
It would be very warm and cozy.

1406
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,875
我们的房子现在这个地段
The price of this location right here

1407
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:03,625
等到时候地铁建起来了
will doubled

1408
01:35:03,708 --> 01:35:05,166
将会有一倍的升值
when the subway is ready.

1409
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:06,416
大约再过十年
And in about ten years later,

1410
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,375
房价就能跟纽约持平了
the price will be the same as the houses in New York.

1411
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:10,125
到时候 您在北京住着
Then, you living in Beijing feels just like living in America.

1412
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:11,583
就像在美国住着一样

1413
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:13,583
您和您的夫人和孩子
You, your wife and children

1414
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,750
在这里共享天伦之乐
will have a wonderful time here.

1415
01:35:15,833 --> 01:35:18,000
其实有钱、有房
Actually, the happiest thing in life

1416
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:19,333
能给家人一个家
is not having money or a house but providing a home for your family.

1417
01:35:19,416 --> 01:35:20,541
才是最幸福的事

1418
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:22,500
这里是阳台
Here is the balcony.

1419
01:35:29,041 --> 01:35:30,875
买房子位置很重要
Location is really important.

1420
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:33,125
品牌开发商、物业公司
The construction and real estate company

1421
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:35,416
都能体现出一个小区的高档
can tell you the class of the complex.

1422
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,833
小区周围都是大环境配套
There are many good spots around the complex.

1423
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:55,583
走啦
Bye.

1424
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:56,541
再见
Bye.

1425
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:09,417
JIAN-QING: ARE YOU GOING BACK HOME THIS YEAR?

1426
01:36:14,667 --> 01:36:19,250
JIAN-QING: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

1427
01:36:24,542 --> 01:36:28,583
JIAN-QING: SHOULD WE GO BACK TOGETHER?

1428
01:36:29,667 --> 01:36:32,417
MY DAD ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT YOU

1429
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:36,625
I COULDN'T TELL HIM THAT WE BROKE UP

1430
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:47,333
你不用看下边这些
You don't have to look at these.

1431
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:48,875
你就记住啊 你看
Just memorize it. Look.

1432
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:50,083
频道
For the channels...

1433
01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:52,416
是吧？这个是高清晰度多媒体接口的
The is the HDMI button.

1434
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:53,875
这个是有线
This is for cable TV.

1435
01:36:53,958 --> 01:36:55,458
你没发现台多了
See. There are more channels.

1436
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:56,958
还有这是音量
This is the volume button.

1437
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:58,500
你试一下
You can try it.

1438
01:37:06,083 --> 01:37:07,500
这不是开了吗？
It is on, right?

1439
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:09,625
近点 离近点
Closer. Get closer.

1440
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:11,708
你再自己试一下
You can give it another try.

1441
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:16,708
按这个
Press this.

1442
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:20,916
我教叔叔吧
I'll teach him.

1443
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:27,833
怎么让我关上了？
Why did I turn it off?

1444
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,833
开开了
It's on.

1445
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,166
叔叔 您看
Look, Uncle.

1446
01:37:32,250 --> 01:37:34,416
啥事儿 不管啥事儿你就按这个
Never mind. Just press this button.

1447
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,125
-OK -OK
OK.

1448
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:37,958
-然后再按一下这个… -我不学了吧
OK.

1449
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:38,125
-This button is for-- -I don't want to learn it.

1450
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:40,916
我这眼睛啊
My sight...

1451
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:43,833
最近不如以前了
is getting worse now.

1452
01:37:44,083 --> 01:37:46,166
看东西老是虚虚乎乎的
I can't see things clearly.

1453
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:52,291
你没去看医生啊？
You didn't go to the doctors?

1454
01:37:53,416 --> 01:37:55,083
应该没什么大不了的吧？
I don't think it's a big deal.

1455
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:58,000
就是老年退化吧
I just got old.

1456
01:37:58,666 --> 01:38:00,583
没事 别担心啊
It's nothing. Don't worry.

1457
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:02,333
爸
-Dad. -Yes?

1458
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:05,541
过完年 你就搬过来跟我们一起住
After New Year, you can move in with us.

1459
01:38:06,041 --> 01:38:07,625
我房子都买好了
I bought a house.

1460
01:38:09,666 --> 01:38:11,791
你们年轻人搬过去就行了
I'll just let you young people live together.

1461
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:13,583
高高兴兴的
All happily.

1462
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:15,458
不用照顾我
There is no need to take care of me.

1463
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,833
搬过来吧
Just move in with us. I had it all decorated.

1464
01:38:16,916 --> 01:38:18,125
都装修好了

1465
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:21,000
到时候你跟小晓一起搬进来住
You and Xiao-xiao can come live together.

1466
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:26,500
我才不去呢
I'm not going.

1467
01:38:27,166 --> 01:38:28,416
你为啥不去啊？
Why not?

1468
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,750
不是 你去了我们也好就近照顾你
We can look after you if you live with us.

1469
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:34,958
我什么时候用你照顾过啊？
I don't need you to look after me.

1470
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,333
那你生病怎么办啊？
What if you get sick?

1471
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:41,041
再说人北京医疗条件比这好太多了
Beijing has better medical treatment than here.

1472
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:43,166
我身体好好的 生什么病啊？
I'm still pretty healthy.

1473
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:48,333
你来北京 到时候咱们把眼睛好好看一看
You can have your eyes checked in Beijing.

1474
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,250
看看到底怎么回事
To see what's wrong with it.

1475
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,333
那怎么着你这…
Or what else would you do?

1476
01:38:53,416 --> 01:38:55,541
后半辈子 你就想在这个破餐馆待着啊？
Staying in this crappy restaurant for the rest of your life?

1477
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:59,416
什么叫破餐馆啊？
What do you mean crappy restaurant?

1478
01:38:59,666 --> 01:39:01,375
供着你吃、供着你喝
It helped me feed you,

1479
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:02,875
供着你读书
and paid your tuition.

1480
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:05,416
怎么就成破餐馆了？
Why is it a crappy restaurant now?

1481
01:39:05,958 --> 01:39:07,666
我离开你去北京 我干吗去了？
Then why did I leave you and go to Beijing for?

1482
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:10,000
我不就是希望咱们可以过点好日子嘛
I want us to have a good life.

1483
01:39:10,083 --> 01:39:11,416
这道理你不懂啊？
Don't you get it?

1484
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:12,750
那是你的好日子
That is a good life for you.

1485
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:14,500
我的好日子就在这
I'm living a good life here.

1486
01:39:15,541 --> 01:39:18,958
你以为你有俩钱 就可以安排别人生活啊？
You think you can simply arrange other people's life when you're rich?

1487
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,708
那怎么着？我就…
So what if I could?

1488
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,166
我就一年回来一次吧
I'll just come back once a year.

1489
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:25,958
你爱回来不回来
Suit yourself.

1490
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:28,250
我不去
I'm not going.

1491
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:40,041
你太过分了
You are too much.

1492
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:41,291
你怎么回事啊？
What's wrong with you?

1493
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,541
什么我怎么回事？
What's wrong with me?

1494
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:43,791
你怎么回事啊？
What's wrong with you?

1495
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:45,541
连你也不懂 是吧？
Don't you get it as well?

1496
01:39:50,333 --> 01:39:51,583
我不懂 我给你买房子
I don't get it. I bought you a house.

1497
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:53,000
我给我爸买房子
I bought my dad a house.

1498
01:39:53,083 --> 01:39:54,916
我以为你们会高兴
I thought you would be happy.

1499
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,083
我有什么问题吗？
Did I do anything wrong?

1500
01:39:57,166 --> 01:39:58,541
你没什么问题
No, you didn't.

1501
01:39:58,625 --> 01:39:59,791
你特别正确
You are so right.

1502
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:02,250
我跟你在一起就是图你一套房子
The reason why I dated you is that you could afford a house.

1503
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:04,000
你爸养你20多年
Your dad raised you for 20 years because all he wants is a house.

1504
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:05,416
就图你一套房子

1505
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:11,208
我银行账户里第一笔钱我什么都没想
When I got my first paycheck,

1506
01:40:11,291 --> 01:40:12,875
我就去看房子了 为什么？
I went straight to find a house. Why?

1507
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,916
不就是因为…
Just because...

1508
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:20,750
不说了
Never mind.

1509
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:22,041
你说
Say it.

1510
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:26,791
不就是因为我没有房子嘛
Just because I didn't have a house...

1511
01:40:29,166 --> 01:40:32,125
我当时跟你分开 不是因为咱们没有房子
I didn't break up with you because of that.

1512
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:33,583
我要的是一个家
I wanted a home.

1513
01:40:34,166 --> 01:40:35,458
我懂
I know.

1514
01:40:35,583 --> 01:40:37,666
我知道你想要的是爱 是一个家
I know you wanted my love and a home.

1515
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:39,250
小晓 我现在可以
I can do it now, Xiao-xiao.

1516
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,375
我现在有钱 我有房子啦
I got the money. I got the house.

1517
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:43,208
我可以让你在北京落户口
I can give you an address in Beijing.

1518
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:44,583
我可以完成你的愿望
I can fulfill your wish.

1519
01:40:44,666 --> 01:40:45,958
这不是爱吗？
Can't this be considered as love?

1520
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:52,083
小晓
Xiao-xiao.

1521
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:54,000
小晓！
Xiao-xiao.

1522
01:40:55,166 --> 01:40:56,541
你是不是有人了？
You have someone else, don't you?

1523
01:41:02,583 --> 01:41:04,083
你是不是有病啊？
Are you out of your mind?

1524
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:13,291
对不起
I'm sorry.

1525
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:16,083
对不起
I'm sorry.

1526
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,125
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean that.

1527
01:41:24,291 --> 01:41:25,750
你再给我一次机会
Please give me another chance.

1528
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:28,708
我一定努力给你最好的
I will do my best.

1529
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,083
如果你觉得当初
If you thought back then

1530
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,583
我不能跟你一起过苦日子
I couldn't endure the tough times with you,

1531
01:41:35,875 --> 01:41:38,541
那你怎么现在就能认为我愿意跟你过
why would you assume that I could live

1532
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:40,916
你想要的那种好日子？
the good life you wanted with you now?

1533
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:50,416
小晓 我真不懂你
Xiao-xiao, I really don't understand you.

1534
01:41:52,458 --> 01:41:54,166
你从来都没懂过
You never did.

1535
01:41:55,333 --> 01:41:56,541
从来都没有
You never did.

1536
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:03,541
我真的已经努力变成了 你想要的样子了
I tried really hard to become what you want me to be.

1537
01:42:09,375 --> 01:42:12,666
可是我现在 已经不是我以前那个样子了
But I'm not the same person now.

1538
01:43:01,125 --> 01:43:03,000
我们还回得了家吗？
Can we make it home?

1539
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:09,708
就像我爸说的
Just like my dad said,

1540
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,833
去到哪里
"Wherever we go,

1541
01:43:12,916 --> 01:43:15,291
都是异乡人
we are the outsiders."

1542
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,583
我爸去世之前
When my dad passed away,

1543
01:43:20,916 --> 01:43:22,541
心里老惦记着你
he was still thinking about you.

1544
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:36,333
爸
Dad.

1545
01:43:38,125 --> 01:43:38,958
见清
-Jian-qing. -Why did you come here?

1546
01:43:39,041 --> 01:43:40,041
你怎么来了？

1547
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:47,458
小晓回来啦？
Xiao-xiao is back.

1548
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:57,750
饿了吧？咱们回家
Are you hungry?

1549
01:43:56,125 --> 01:43:57,083
Let's go home.

1550
01:43:57,833 --> 01:43:59,166
扶着点我爸
Hold my dad.

1551
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,208
有一天我在路上开车
I was driving one day,

1552
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:29,875
看见你开了一个红色跑车
and I saw you in a red sports car.

1553
01:44:30,583 --> 01:44:32,875
然后我就跟着你 左拐右拐
I followed you everywhere.

1554
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,166
你开得太猛了 我真追不上
You were going too fast, I couldn't catch up.

1555
01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:39,625
我要是能追上你就好了
It would be great if I caught up with you.

1556
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:43,375
红色跑车 你还记得吗？
The red sports car. Remember?

1557
01:44:44,208 --> 01:44:47,041
当时我答应过你要给你买两台一样的
I promised I'd buy two of them for you.

1558
01:44:47,125 --> 01:44:48,208
换着开
You could take turns to drive them.

1559
01:44:57,333 --> 01:45:00,083
我从来没有开过什么红色跑车
I never drove any red sports car before.

1560
01:45:01,541 --> 01:45:03,625
你大概是因为太想我了
You missed me too much.

1561
01:45:03,708 --> 01:45:05,333
所以就觉得见到我了
So it was just your imagination.

1562
01:45:40,791 --> 01:45:41,791
走啦
Time to leave.

1563
01:45:57,833 --> 01:46:00,458
之前分开得都匆匆忙忙的
We always parted in a hurry.

1564
01:46:01,125 --> 01:46:02,125
这次
This time,

1565
01:46:02,458 --> 01:46:03,833
咱们好好说再见
let's bid our farewell properly.

1566
01:46:05,250 --> 01:46:06,458
林见清
Jian-qing Lin.

1567
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:07,375
再见
Goodbye.

1568
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:10,708
方小晓

想不负此生真的很难
